# TronPixels: Unleash Your Creativity on the Blockchain

Welcome to **TronPixels**, a decentralized platform where creativity meets blockchain technology. TronPixels allows users to design and share pixel art directly on the **BitTorrent Chain (BTTC)**, combining artistic expression with the power of decentralized, immutable technology.

## Introduction

"Have you ever thought about the difference between drawing something by hand and creating something pixel by pixel? While a pen allows for fluid lines, creating pixel art requires precision. Each square plays a critical role, building up a bigger picture piece by piece—like a puzzle where every element matters. TronPixels takes this concept further by merging creativity with blockchain, making every single pixel a secure and verifiable element of the decentralized web."

TronPixels is more than just a pixel art platform—it’s a space where users can freely express themselves, contribute to a global community of creators, and enjoy the power of decentralized technology. Each user creation is saved immutably on the blockchain, ensuring transparency, ownership, and engagement without limits or barriers.

## Features

### 1. Decentralized Pixel Art Creation
TronPixels offers a canvas for users to create pixel art directly in their browser. This art is stored in a **25x25 grid**, where each pixel is represented by a color and/or structure.

### 2. Blockchain-Powered Storage
Every artwork created on TronPixels is saved on the **BitTorrent Chain (BTTC)**. The data includes:
- The **grid layout** (colors and structures for each square).
- The **creator's address**.
- **Timestamp** of submission.
- **Tags** associated with the creation.

### 3. Two Smart Contracts for Functionality
- **Canvas Contract**: Responsible for storing the pixel data of each artwork.
- **Upvote Contract**: Allows users to upvote their favorite pixel artworks, promoting engagement and interaction in the TronPixels community.

### 4. Freedom of Expression
TronPixels is more than just art. It’s a canvas for free speech. Users can express their thoughts, creativity, and ideas without censorship, protected by the transparency and security of blockchain.

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts

#### 1. Canvas Smart Contract
Each artwork is stored as a **25x25 grid**, where every pixel holds a unique color or structure. The smart contract allows users to:
- Submit pixel art to the blockchain.
- Retrieve past artworks by querying the creator's address and timestamp.

Each canvas submission includes:
- **Grid data** (the pixel colors and structures).
- **Metadata** (title, description, tags).
- **Creator's wallet address** and **submission date**.

#### 2. Upvote Smart Contract
Users can upvote their favorite pixel artworks, creating a decentralized system of community engagement. Each upvote is stored on-chain, and artwork popularity is tracked based on the number of votes.

## User Interface & Experience

### Frontend
Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, TronPixels provides a simple, intuitive interface where users can:
- **Create pixel art** on a 25x25 grid.
- **Choose colors** and **structures** to enhance their creations.
- **Submit artwork** to the blockchain in just a few clicks.
- **View, upvote, and interact** with community creations.

### Storing Pixel Data
Each grid square is mapped to its corresponding color or structure, which is then stored on-chain. This ensures that every single pixel is:
- **Immutable**: Once stored, it cannot be altered.
- **Transparent**: Anyone can view the grid’s history, ensuring authenticity.

### Canvas Overview
Users can **view all artwork** created within the community, sorted by the latest submissions or most upvoted entries.
